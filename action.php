                    issues like ending gun violence, supporting economic justice, combating climate change, passing immigration

                <p>Campaigns using our <a href="#">FREE TOOL SET</a> have been big and small, heroic and ordinary. What’s important is

            <p>Petitions aren’t new—they’re as old as the ancient prophets crying out for justice (think Moses asking Pharoah
                to let his people go).</p>
            <p>But now the Internet offers us radically powerful tools to attract and mobilize thousands of people, all around
                the world, at lightning speed (or however long it takes your Time Warner Cable to load). We provide a digital
                toolset and more so you can make change harder, better, faster, stronger.</p>

            <p><b>Creating change is hard. It’s easier when you have help. That’s what we’re here for.</b> We’ve helped dozens of faith leaders and organizers start and run campaigns, leverage their social
                networks (and expand into new ones!), get national media coverage, and organize to make change.</p>
            <p>Here’s a sample walk-through of what it’s like to work with us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You call or email us with a campaign idea</li>
                <li>We explore it together—What are your goals? Is that the right target?</li>
                <li>What’s a timeline that makes sense? etc.</li>
                <li>You feel ready to get your campaign online—woo!</li>
                <li>You can send us a draft of your campaign text and we’ll provide edits and suggestions (a personal story always helps, for example)</li>
                <li>You put up the final version—it looks great!</li>
                <li>We help you think through a communications plan for sharing the campaign with your email lists, social media followers, and other networks</li>
                <li>We strategize campaign escalation—What are your next steps? How can you reach out to the media? What’s the right time to do a petition delivery?</li>
                <li>Repeat last step until SUCCESS</li>
