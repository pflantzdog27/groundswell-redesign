            <p>Online organizing? Email blasts? Social media? Facebook and Twitter? Websites? Petitions? What about
                good ol’ one-on-ones and days of action?</p>
            <p>You’re right, nothing can replace the importance of building relationships and organizing communities
                on the ground. But we hold this conviction alongside another one -- that the Internet offers a new set
                of radically powerful tools that create opportunities for mass mobilization, ethical spectacles, media
                making, fundraising, and more that can dramatically enhance your ability to make the change you seek.</p>

            <p>As people of faith, we are people of the story. Yet as change-makers, we often fail to deploy our strongest

            <p>Faith-rooted story-telling, in particular, has the unique ability to open hearts, so that we can open minds
            to our causes. Our trainers apply the theory of story-telling to the multifaith movement for justice, offering
            cutting-edge, practical, faith-rooted trainings in how to effectively communicate through story.</p>
